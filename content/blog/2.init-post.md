# Welcome
The first thing I was told on my path to becoming a developer was that **I need a portfolio site**. This was back in [{{ customVariable }}]{style="font-weight: bold;"}
<!--More-->

I've admittedly been dragging my feet to put one together.

So, this is my first post. 

## Why?

### I'm a learner Dottie, a rebel. 
> eventually a gif goed here

### ***I am not an expert.*** **But I am a learner**. 

And I think it's important to document learning in whatever I'm working on. In fact, I'm writing the content to this blog while I'm building it out.


## What to Expect

The idea is to start with as bare minimum as possible, and add features incrementally while providing documentation on what I'm building, what I'm learning, and other thoughts around being a human who codes.

I'm very much looking forward to building out this blog and showcasing projects and learnings.
