# Nuxt 3 Personal Blog 

## About
This is a personal blog that highlights who I am as a Web Engineer, what I'm learning, and projects I'm working on. This blog was built using Nuxt 3. You can check out the branches dropdown to take a peak at my process. Each branch is a new concept I was working through at the time. 

This blog will get published on AWS... eventually ðŸ˜….

Shout out to these great resources for helping me fill in some knowleges gaps on Nuxt and Vue 3 stuff.
